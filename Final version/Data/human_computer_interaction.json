  "coreConcepts": [
    "Usability -- the capacity of a system to provide a condition for its users to perform the tasks safely, effectively, and efficiently while enjoying the experience",
    "User-centered Design -- a framework of processes in which usability goals, user characteristics, environment, tasks and workflow of a product, service or brand are given extensive attention at each stage of the design process. This attention includes testing which is conducted during each stage of design and development from the envisioned requirements, through pre-production models to post production.",
    "Feedback -- the system's response to a user's action, providing information about what has been done and what has been accomplished. This communication helps users understand the result of their actions and whether their intended goals have been achieved",
    "Affordances --  the properties of an object or interface that suggest how it can be used. In HCI, affordances are cues that help users understand what actions are possible with a digital interface or a physical object.",
    "Consistency -- the principle that similar operations and elements should behave similarly within and across interfaces. This predictability helps users build mental models and reduces the learning curve when interacting with new systems.",
    "Learnability -- how easy it is for users to accomplish basic tasks the first time they encounter the interface and how quickly they can reach proficiency.",
    "Error Prevention & Handling -- design strategies that aim to reduce the likelihood of user errors and to make errors easy to recover from if they occur.",
    "Accessibility -- the design of interfaces that ensure people of all abilities, including those with disabilities, can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with digital systems effectively."

  "keyProblems": [
    "Usability and Learnability: Designing interfaces that are easy to learn and use for diverse users.",
    "Accessibility: Ensuring interfaces are usable by people with disabilities (e.g., visual, motor, cognitive impairments).",
    "User Diversity: Accounting for differences in users\u2019 age, culture, language, expertise, and preferences.",
    "Context of Use: Designing for varied contexts (mobile, desktop, VR) and environments (noisy, multitasking).",
    "Keeping Up with Technology: Rapidly evolving tech (e.g., AI, IoT, AR/VR) creates new interaction challenges.",
    "Privacy and Security: Balancing data collection, user trust, and protection of sensitive data.",
    "Emotional and Social Impact: Considering how interactions affect users\u2019 emotions, well-being, and social behavior.",
